# Lock & Key

 A Foundry VTT module to handle locking and unlocking of doors and tokens

### Basic use:

A gm can shift+right-click doors and loot containers (PF2e or Item Piles) to create a new key for them in the item sections. Every play that has a key in their inventory can lock or unlock matching doors and tokens with a right-click. Locked tokens can not be looted.
